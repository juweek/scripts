Thanks so much for agreeing to add the qualifying comments.  As our CFO said, it’s hard to feel like “yes” is the appropriate response for some of these questions, as in the 30 years she has been in Finance at the MGH, most such these measures have not been taken. But they are mentioned in the policies to keep open the possibility for a situation that may call for such measures.
 
To specifically respond to the questions below, the answers are 1.) we do have in our policy that allows us to use collection agencies and we have done so on occasions; and 2.) we do not sell our patient debt to third-party debt buyers.

FAP states that they do allow ECAs, but Duke Helfand says it is a rare occurance. They do not often engage in ECAs.","Cedars-Sinai makes sure that anyone who requires our services can access them, regardless of their ability to pay. When a patient cannot afford to pay for their care, or if their personal financial situation changes, we work directly with them to accommodate their unique circumstances.
 
Our financial assistance policy is among the most generous of its kind in the country. We provide free care to patients earning as much as 400% of the Federal Poverty Level ($106,000 for a family of four in 2021).  We also provide substantial discounts for those patients earning 401% to 600% of the Federal Poverty Level ($106,265 to $159,000 for a family of four in 2021).  These levels go beyond minimum levels set by state and federal requirements. 
 
Over the last five years, Cedars-Sinai has provided $163 million in ""charity care"" financial assistance to nearly 93,000 patients who needed help paying for their medical care.
 
During that same period, we absorbed $451 million in losses related to more than 244,000 patient encounters where the patient (or in some cases, the insurance plan) did not pay for the care provided.
 
Cedars-Sinai policy does allow for the extraordinary collection actions you mentioned in your email. The fact that we have a policy on paper, however, misses the true story. The real question to understand is how the policy is applied in practice.
 
On the extremely rare occasions when we pursue extraordinary collection efforts (as you describe), we do so only with patients who decline to pay their bills despite evidence of substantial ability to pay.
 
To put our practice into context: Over the last five years, we have taken legal action against 15 patients (including three international patients). This amounts to 0.00002% of the total 779,448 unique patients who were treated and billed during this period. (One of these patients received payment for care directly from an insurance company but refused to remit the payment to Cedars-Sinai.)
 
Cedars-Sinai has never garnished a patient's wages or put a lien on their home to satisfy payment for medical bills.
 
Thank you for taking a few moments to read and understand this important context. We believe this information is vital to developing a more complete understanding of the ""yes"" or ""no"" questions in the survey.",,,44000

If you still cannot pay your bill after all other attempts have been made, we will work with our collection agencies, including the Oregon Department of Revenue, to recover payment with no interest charged. We care deeply about our patients and will never suspend your license, report you to credit bureaus, place liens on your property, charge late fees or file judgments/suits in an attempt to collect a debt.

No, Sanford Health does not report patients’ medical debt to credit rating agencies. 
 
Do you sell debt to third party debt buyers?
We do not sell our accounts to third party buyers.  

Do you restrict care for patients with unpaid bills?
No. As a nonprofit organization, Sanford Health provides a robust community care program to help our patients who are uninsured or experiencing financial hardship access care in hospitals and clinics across our health system. The vast majority of our patients who are uninsured qualify for free or reduced health care through our charity care program if we are not able to help them qualify for alternative coverage.  
 
We provide significant financial assistance for those who need help with medical bills. Medical debt is a hardship that we don’t want any family to experience. We provide financial assistance for 95 percent of those who apply for support and as a matter of practice have limited the pursuit of medical debt through the courts. In 2020 alone, Sanford Health provided more than $93 million in charity care for those unable to pay for medical services. In addition, that same year Sanford Health wrote off $55 million in bad debt from patients who were unable to pay.
